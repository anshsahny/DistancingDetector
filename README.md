# DistancingDetector
This is a Social Distancing Tool that uses the concepts of Computer Vision. Using the weights of the YOLO v3 Object Detection Algorithm and the COCO datase,
along with OpenCV library and the Deep Neural Network (dnn) module, the input video is broken down into frames where each individual in the frame is checked
with other individuals to see if they are socially distant from them via the distance between the centers of both individuals.
